Data driven diagrams.


Dictim is a Clojure/ Babashka library for representing a diagram using a subset of Clojure's edn data format. It then allows you to compile the edn into either Terrastruct's [d2](https://github.com/terrastruct/d2) or Graphviz's [dot](https://graphviz.org/doc/info/lang.html) languages. You can use either the d2 or graphviz executable to produce the diagram.


Dictim has deeper support for d2. d2 text can be parsed into dictim format.


You can also install dictim as a command line tool; details below.


Clojurescript support is experimental.

## Basic usage

Let's round trip from dictim to d2, and back!

### From dictim to d2

dictim and d2 have three principle types of elements: shapes, connections and containers.

Here's an example of producing a d2 specifiction of a diagram with two shapes and a connection:

```clojure
user=> (use 'dictim.d2.compile)
nil
user=> (d2 [:s1 "Shape 1"][:s2 "Shape 2"][:s1 "->" :s2 "reln"])
"s1: Shape 1\ns2: Shape 2\ns1 -> s2: reln"

```

When sent to the d2 CLI executable:

### From d2 to dictim

let's turn the above d2 string back into dictim.

```clojure
user=> (use 'dictim.d2.parse)
nil
user> (dictim "s1: Shape 1\ns2: Shape 2\ns1 -> s2: reln" :key-fn keyword)
([:s1 "Shape 1"] [:s2 "Shape 2"] [:s1 "->" :s2 "reln"])

```

For details on dictim syntax, the compile, parse and other operations, please see the [wiki](https://github.com/judepayne/dictim/wiki).


## Command line tool

This project contains a command line tool version (a babashka script) that you can install and use to play with dictim on the command line! See the [wiki](https://github.com/judepayne/dictim/wiki/Command-Line) for details.
